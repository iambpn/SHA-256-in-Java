While coding sha 256 in java i learned following things:-

1. we need to work with signed integers only.
2. parseInt is unsigned  i.e it will give unsigned resut which will make output larger so to minimize it i used BigInteger. for example: 
`new BigInteger(str,2).intValue();` this wil return signed integer value.
3. Right shift (>>>) is unsigned right shift and we use this for right shifting bits.
4. Integer.rotateRight() function will provide signed output.
