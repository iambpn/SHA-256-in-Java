While coding doing sha 256 in java i learned =>

1. we will work with signed integers only.
2. parseInt is unsigned  i.e it will give unsigned resut which will make output larger.
	so to minimize i use BigInteger. E.G
		new BigInteger(str,2).intValue();
	this wil return signed value in int.
3. this right shift (>>>) is unsigned right shift and we use this for right shift.
4. Integer.rotateRight() function will provide signed output.
